# Sonar-XSL-Plugin

*A Schematron-based SonarQube plugin for XSL code quality measurement.*


it brings the benefits of SonarQube to XSL projects :
* Continuous Quality measurement
* Interactive documentation of best-practices

## Contact / Updates roadmap

**Contact** : Sonar-XSL-Plugin is mainly maintained by [Jim Etevenard](https://github.com/jimetevenard)

**Development roadmap and upcoming updates** :  
See [main milestones](https://github.com/sonar-xsl/Sonar-XSL-Plugin/milestones) and [active issues](https://github.com/sonar-xsl/Sonar-XSL-Plugin/issues) on *Github*

## How it works

**This plugin runs an XSL-related Best-practice Schematron on each XSLT file of your project.**

It embeds the [xslt-quality](https://github.com/mricaud/xslt-quality) schematron from @mricaud.  
That Schematron Script, based on [Mukul Gandhi's work](http://gandhimukul.tripod.com/xslt/xslquality.html), checks some common XSL pitfalls.

### A few examples of rules :

* Variables should be typed
* The use of wildcard namespaces `*:` in xpath statements should be avoided
* Using `xsl:for-each` on nodes may be a clue of procedural programming ;
You should maybe consider using `xsl:apply-templates` instead
* boolean `true() or `false()` value should be used instead of litteral strings `'true'` and `'false'`
* Costly double-slash operator should be used with caution
* Global variables (...) should have a namespace to improve the portability of your stylesheet
* etc.

Since this plugin is open source, one can embed any additional Schematron script to support custom rules.

## Download and install

Public releases are available on Github :  
<https://github.com/sonar-xsl/Sonar-XSL-Plugin/releases>

1. Download `sonar-xsl-plugin-x.x.x.jar` from the link above
2. Copy it to `$SONARQUBE_HOME/extensions/plugins`
3. Restart your SonarQube instance and *voilà*.

In most cases, on Linux, `$SONARQUBE_HOME` refers to `/opt/sonarqube/` making the full path to be `/opt/sonarqube/extensions/plugins/`

The process of installing a SonarQube plugin is documented here :  
<https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/install-plugin/>, see § *Manual Installation*

## Build from sources

The Sonar-XSL-Plugin is built *via* Maven.

Running `mvn package` will invoke  the [sonar-packaging-maven-plugin](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-packaging-maven-plugin) to build a SonarQube-Ready JAR file.

**The JAR to be installed in SonarQube will be delivered at `/sonar-xsl-plugin/target/sonar-xsl-plugin-1.x.x.jar`**

## Architecture / Extending

It embeds two main modules

#### Sonar-Schematron-Reactor

Makes the link between Schematron and the SonarQube API.

Cf. <https://github.com/sonar-xsl/Sonar-Schematron-Reactor>

#### Some Schematrons modules

Out of the box, the unique [xslt-quality](https://github.com/mricaud/xslt-quality)

Packaged for this plugin, via the dedicated Maven Plugin. (See module ./sonar-schematron-packaging-plugin)

This mechanism can be used to extend this plugin :

1. Write some XSL-Related Schematron rules
2. Package them with the plugin
3. Add the resulting artifact as a dependency

## So, does it actually works ?

:+1: **Yes, it works !**

### Still,  there is some TODOs to fix :

See [Issues](https://github.com/sonar-xsl/Sonar-XSL-Plugin/issues) and [next Milestones](https://github.com/sonar-xsl/Sonar-XSL-Plugin/milestones)

#### Realese and pushish !

* Make a release
* Publish it somewhere (Maven central ?)
* Produce a Docker image to test fastly, and publish it on Docker Hub (see https://github.com/sonar-xsl/Sonar-XSL-Plugin/milestone/1)

As for now, if you wana try it, you have to build it locally from the sources.

#### The execution is quite slow...

NB : The actual implementation is based on the [Skeleton XSLT implementation](https://github.com/Schematron/schematron) of ISO-Schematron.

#### Improve the integration with SonarQube

* The native Code Duplication Detection does not work.
* Highlighting from [SonarSource/sonar-xml](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-xml) integrated in a quick-lazy way...

#### Improve the integration of [xslt-quality](https://github.com/mricaud/xslt-quality) ruleSet.

* I need to package it and add some SonarQube-specific annotation.
* For that purpose, [I temporarily forked it](https://github.com/jimetevenard/xslt-quality)
* I'm working on a cleaner integration : Importing it as a Maven dependency, and then adding the annotations via XSLT.
* The schematron may have itself some dependencies that needs to be resolved, so there is a little bit of work

#### Integration with the XSPEC Maven plugin

To bring XSLT code coverage into SonarQube
